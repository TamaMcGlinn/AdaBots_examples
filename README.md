Your AdaBots project
====================

Welcome to your AdaBots project! Inside 'programs' you will find a test.adb
file to start from. Right now, it just makes the bot move up and down.

Feel free to change it, it's yours!

Build & Run
===========

When you're done changing the program, you need to build; this tells the
compiler to create a binary inside bin/ which you can run to see the bot move.

Press Control+Shift+B to build the file you have open. Then press F5 to run it.
